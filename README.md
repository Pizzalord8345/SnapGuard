# SnapGuard

An advanced snapshot manager for Linux systems with Btrfs support.

## Main Features

### Security
- **File-level encryption**: Each file is individually encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Secure key management**: 
  - Key derivation with PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)
  - Separate keys for encryption and signing
  - Secure key storage in protected directories
- **Digital signing**: 
  - HMAC-SHA256 signatures for each file
  - Integrity verification before export
  - Snapshot verification during restoration

### Snapshot Management
- **Intelligent retention**:
  - Differentiated retention policies (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Automatic selection of important snapshots
  - Configurable retention periods
- **Multiple subvolumes**: 
  - Support for multiple Btrfs subvolumes
  - Individual configuration per subvolume
  - Parallel snapshot creation

### Backup and Export
- **Secure backups**:
  - Overall backup checksum (SHA-256)
  - Integrity verification before export
  - Complete metadata documentation
- **Flexible export options**:
  - Support for various target media
  - Preservation of all security features
  - Automatic verification after export

### User Interface
- **GTK-based GUI**:
  - Clear overview of all snapshots
  - Easy management of retention policies
  - Security settings configuration
- **Systemd integration**:
  - Automatic snapshot creation
  - Configurable schedules
  - Reliable operation as system service

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Detailed audit logging**:
  - Logging of all operations
  - Success and error logs
  - Metrics and statistics
- **Notifications**:
  - Desktop notifications
  - Email notifications (optional)
  - System logging
