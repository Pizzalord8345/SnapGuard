# Contributing to SnapGuard

First off, thank you for considering contributing to SnapGuard! It's people like you that make SnapGuard such a great tool.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SnapGuard. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**
* Check the [issues](link-to-issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
* Make sure you're using the latest version of SnapGuard.
* Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an issue with your environment (e.g., btrfs or overlayfs availability on your system).

**How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?**
Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](link-to-issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture and a memory heap snapshot with your report.
* **If the problem is related to file system operations**, include relevant details about your file system setup and permissions.
* **Include details about your environment**:
  * Which version of SnapGuard are you using?
  * What's the name and version of your OS?
  * Are you using BTRFS, OverlayFS, or both?
  * Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And if not, how often does it happen?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for SnapGuard, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion:**
* Check if there's already a feature that provides your suggested enhancement.
* Determine if your enhancement is related to the core SnapGuard functionality.
* Check if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing request instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion?**

* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
* Maintain SnapGuard's quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible tool
